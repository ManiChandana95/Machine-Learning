LSTM for stock data prediction # Machine-Learning

Implemented Long Short Term Memory networks (slight modification of Recurrent Neural Networks that are not affected by
the vanishing gradient problem)with both forward and backward propagation, for predicting the future stocks.
Collected the stock data of about 3 years from the yahoo website and used k-fold cross validation technique for classifying the 
data as train and test split.
